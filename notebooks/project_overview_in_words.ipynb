    "HOW DO WE DO THIS ANALYSIS? <br>\n",
    "Following Hawkins and Sutton (2012), we make two basic calculations: <br>\n",
    "1) <b> noise: </b> We calculate noise by estimating the standard deviation of tas in the piControl (pre-industrial control) simulation, which we call $$\\sigma$$.  This simulation should estimate natural variability in the absence of anthropogenic forcing. This should be a function of latitude and longitude (i.e., $$\\sigma$$ will vary in space) <br>\n",
    "2) <b> signal: </b> We estimate the signal using a simple linear regression.  We create a smoothed global average tas time series (T<sub>global</sub>), and we regress this on our temperature at each gridpoint. We are assuming that T<sub>global</sub> is a good representation of anthropogenic warming. The idea is that the regression will estimate the fraction of local tas (temperature at that gridpoint) that can be explained by T<sub>global</sub>--that is, how much of the temperature trend over time at that gridpoint can be explained by T<sub>global</sub>? <br>\n",
    "Mathematically, our regression looks like this: \n",
    "$$S(t) = \\alpha T_{global}(t) + \\beta$$ <br>\n",
    "So, we create our <b>signal</b> (S), which is a function of time, and we use it to predict a temperature time series at each gridpoint [lon x lat x time].  We then compare this estimate to the <b> noise </b> ([lon x lat]), and we determine the time at which $$\\frac{signal}{noise}$$ exceeds some threshold. This is our <b> time of emergence </b>."

    "2) After we have computed <b> ToE </b> for each model, we can estimate some sort of average <b> ToE </b> across our ensemble (HS12 use median). This plot will also be a [lon x lat] plot. We can also estimate lower and upper bounds on this estimate (10th/90th or 5th/95th percentiles?), again in [lon x lat] <br>\n",
